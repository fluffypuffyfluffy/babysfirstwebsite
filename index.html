      <p>I'm an artist and researcher, based in Los Angeles. As a researcher, I work with social movement spaces to further projects of collective liberation. Most recently, I worked as Research Director for Where Is My Land, an organization that seeks restitution for Black families in the US who have experienced land dispossession within their lineage. In the past, I have supported groups such as the Solidarity Research Center, CodePink, the Garment Workers Center, Youth Justice Coalition, Downtown Crenshaw, The UCLA Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy, and SWAN Vancouver. I'm currently working on a movement research guide (coming soon!) and will be leading a workshop on movement research at DeepMay in August.</p>
      <p>My artistic practices weaves between many disciplines -- like I said, I'm a gemini! From 2017-2019, I co-led a social practice and creative placemaking collective alongside El Arkin and Renee Miles Rooijmans, called frida&frank. We designed and fabricated our own ping-pong tables and played games with strangers across greater Vancouver as an invitation to talk about the commons, community, and how we our environments can be spaces for bottom-up collaboration rather than led by bureaucracy. More recently, I've been a part of an alternative education project based in Los Angeles, called F.R.A.C.T.A.L.. I'm also a culinary artist, with a sweet spot for cakes. My favourite cakes I've made are ones that act as a temporary archive of seasonality and story. Sometimes my cakes are more sculptural, sometimes they're digital. Sometimes I make wedding cakes, sometimes I do pop-ups, both independently and at restaurants. Sometimes the cakes are grief rituals and poems. Some times I write about them! Check out my guide to baking here. I also do food styling. I make food other than cakes too! More than anything, I love to play :). My culinary project, as well as my DJing are nestled under the moniker 'Lovening Agent'.</p> 
      <p>Lately, my creative practice has been merging with my collaborator and partner, Whisper, building  software, hardware, and wetware (ritual) for collective home-making. Check out our website here! We're about to head off on a whorld tour at the end of July and will be frolicking across North America and Europe. We love to meet people and also read together -- Come join us for office hours, or send us an email to connect!</p>
